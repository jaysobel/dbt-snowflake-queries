  - name: stg_snowflake_query_table_columns
    description: |
      Snowflake queries' uniquely accessed table and view columns. A row of this table represents a reference 
      to a table or view's column by a Snowflake query. Further explained by Snowflake's documentation.
      It is necessary to re-flatten the direct_objects_accessed blob because the usage of distinct in 
      stg_snowflake_query_tables may have destroyed different sets of columns across query-table duplicates.
